# Twitter Classification
In this project, we use real tweets to find patterns in the way people use social media.

There are two parts to this project:

* In the __first part__, we make a system that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a _K-Nearest Neighbor classifier_. 
* In the __second part__ of this project, we test the power of _Naive Bayes classifiers_ by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. 

This project is done using:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn
